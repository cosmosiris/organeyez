### Organ Eyez
This app was intended to be an accountability app for social justice organizations that allows them to manage projects, facilitate accountability processes, and track membership participation. The first iteration of this project is done in sinatra and incomplete. I plan to rebuild the app from scratch with a much more complex database schema. 

### Forking This App

1. `bundle install`
