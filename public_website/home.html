    <div id="why">
    <p>Why should I use it?</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Transparency</em>: “Active member” profiles and accountability processes are visible to all members. This kind of transparency increases trust, visibility, and understanding.</li><br>
      <li><em>Productivity</em>: Establishing membership expectations increases personal responsibility and incentivizes active contribution. Those who are not meeting membership expectations can be easily identified and given the support they need.</li><br>
      <li><em>Accountability</em>: The transparency of member profiles allows members to more easily hold each other accountable to the organization's expectations. In addition, Organ Eyez provides an Accountability Tracking Tool on which members can update each other about ongoing accountability processes, share reflections, and comment on each other’s progress.</li><br>
      <li><em>Membership Development</em>: visible acknowledgement of member contributions or lack of contributions will allow your organization to praise those who need to be praised and identify those who need additional support. This addresses participation concerns quickly, leading to greater accountability and productivity.</li><br>
      <li><em>Stronger Relationships</em>: Organ Eyez provides a social media alternative to Facebook that is internal and private. Members can share sensitive updates, opinions, and ideas that will only be seen by active members of their organization.</li><br>
      <li><em>Faster Decisions & better communications</em>: Slack integrations allow for both team and direct messaging as well as voting. </li><br>
      <li><em>Efficient Project Management</em></li>
    </ul>
