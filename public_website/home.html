  <p id="intro">The accountability app for social justice organizations</p>

  <div id="who">
    <p><strong>Who is this app for?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>volunteer-based and membership-based social justic groups</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="what">
    <p><strong>What does it do?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides a private social media platform where members can share status updates and internal organizational communications</li><br>
      <li>Facilitates transparent accountability processes</li><br>
      <li>Displays membership expectations and each member's progress towards fulfilling their membership expectations</li><br>
      <li>Tracks membership participation and attendance</li><br>
      <li>Provides a voting platform for both large-scale voting and small-scale polling</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <div id="why">
    <p><strong>Why should I use it?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Transparency</em>: All member profiles are visible to all members. This kind of transparency increases trust, visibility, and understanding.</li><br>
      <li><em>Accountability</em>: The transparency of member profiles allows members to more easily hold each other accountable to the organization's expectations. Members can share reflections on their accountability processes and comment on each otherâ€™s progress. </li><br>
      <li><em>Productivity</em>: Establishing membership expectations increases personal responsibility and incentivizes active contribution. Those who are not meeting membership expectations can be easily identified and given the support they need.</li><br>
      <li><em>Membership Growth</em>: visible acknowledgement of member contributions or lack of contributions will allow your organization to praise those who need to be praised and identify those who need additional support. This addresses participation concerns quickly, producing stronger relationships, greater accountability, and faster growth in membership of dedicated individuals.</li><br>
      <li><em>Faster Decisions & better communications</em>: Slack integrations allow for both team and direct messaging as well as voting. </li><br>
      <li><em>Efficient Project Management</em> through Asana integration.</li>

    </ul>
